# FT-V

All STLs contained in the FT-V Phase 1 modification are directly modified Voron Design STLs or heavily inspired from them. All I have done is perform slight modifications where necessary to fit in the FT-5 printer envelope.

Key:
-Any file name in all lower case comes directly from a Voron Design repository with no modifications
-Any file name with the first letter of each word capitalized is a modified part. The name will have an "FT-V" at the end of it, and generally follows a similar naming convention to the original Voron Design part
-The overall folder structure is similar to the forked Voron Design repositories
-The folder names reference the Voron printer design the parts came from (Either V1.6 or V2.1)

-If the file name has an underscore "_" in front of the text, it is meant to be printed in an accent color (for example, Paramount's Enzo Red ABS).
-If the file name does not have an underscore in front of the text, it is meant to be printed in a base color (for example, eSun's Black ABS+)
-Any part that requires more than one copy to be printed will have x2, x3, etc to specify the number of copies needed
