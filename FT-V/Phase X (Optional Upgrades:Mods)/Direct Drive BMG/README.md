# FT-V

Beta mod to add a BMG direct drive extruder on to the top of the carriage. Has options for both MGN9 and MGN12 X rails. Note--the VORON cable cover doors will not fit with this mod, and it may be difficult to find a place for the wires in your hotend. 

This is largely untested at the moment. Use at your own risk.
