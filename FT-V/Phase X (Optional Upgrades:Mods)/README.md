# FT-V

Optional FT-V Upgrades (Phase 1)
     -Add a Raspberry Pi to be able to run Octoprint and Klipper. Only klipper configs will be provided (~$50)
     -Upgrade to 24V! Perfect time to do it--only need new 200W 24V PSU (~$25)
     -Upgrade to TMC drivers for silent opertation--suggested to buy TMC2209s and the SKR 1.3 control board (~$42-50 from BigTreeTech on Aliexpress))
     -Convert printer to blind joints instead of the FT-5 corner brackets (~$20) - this allows easy enclosing
     -Enclose printer with coroplast and acrylic for easy ABS printing (needs blind joints) (~$100)

Phase 2 and above:
     -Add an FSR probe (or whatever solution V2.2 has) so that when you change toolheads, you don't have to adjust offset (~$8)
     -Purchase longer MGN9H rail for X axis so that you can support full width of printer (~$20)
